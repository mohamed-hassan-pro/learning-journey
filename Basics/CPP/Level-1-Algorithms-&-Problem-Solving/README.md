# 02 â€“ Algorithms & Problem-Solving Level 1

**Course Overview:**  
This course marks the **first step in structured problem-solving**.  
Here, I worked on a collection of beginner-friendly problems covering **geometry, arithmetic, and logical reasoning**.  
Each exercise sharpened my ability to:  
- Break problems into smaller steps.  
- Apply conditional logic and mathematical operations.  
- Write clean and modular C++ code.
