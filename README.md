# üöÄ Learning Journey ‚Äî Dr. Abu Hadhoud‚Äôs 24-Course Roadmap

Welcome! üëã  
This repository documents my complete programming roadmap following **Dr. Mohamed Abou Hadhoud** on [ProgrammingAdvices](https://programmingadvices.com/p/roadmap).  
It contains **24 structured courses** that take me step by step from basics to advanced problem solving and real projects.
