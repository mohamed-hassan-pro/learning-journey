# ðŸš€ Learning Journey â€” Dr. Abu Hadhoudâ€™s 24-Course Roadmap

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository documents my complete programming roadmap following **Dr. Mohamed Abou Hadhoud** on [ProgrammingAdvices]([https://programmingadvices.com/](https://programmingadvices.com/p/roadmap)).  
It contains **24 structured courses** that take me step by step from basics to advanced problem solving and real projects.
