# My Software Engineering Journey (2025-2026)

Welcome to the repository for my dedicated, one-year learning journey, which will conclude at the end of **September 2026**. This documents my path to building a powerful foundation in computer science and software engineering.

While this repository covers my core curriculum, it's just one piece of the puzzle. In parallel, I am honing my mobile development skills (Android with Kotlin) through the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative**. I will be sharing my progress and key learnings from that experience on my LinkedIn profile, so be sure to **[follow me there!]([YOUR_LINKEDIN_PROFILE_URL](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-hassan-pro/))**. Other projects will be shared in separate repositories.

The comprehensive curriculum by Dr. Mohamed Abou Hadhoud on the [ProgrammingAdvices](https://programmingadvices.com/p/roadmap) platform **serves as the foundational backbone of my roadmap**. This plan is further **enriched with a variety of external courses** and specialized learning materials:

### Priority 1: Competitive Programming & Algorithmic Excellence

My primary focus is to build deep expertise in preparation for competitive programming. My ambition is to compete in the **ECPC (Egyptian Collegiate Programming Contest)** next year, with the ultimate goal of qualifying for the **ACPC (Africa and Arab Collegiate Programming Contest)**.

To achieve this, my focus will be on the following core areas:
* C++
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Data Structures & Algorithms
* Problem Solving

This track includes 13 essential courses, supplemented by a thorough study of **SOLID Principles**. I believe mastering these principles is crucial for evolving from a simple coder into a veteran software engineer.

### Priority 2: Synergy with University Curriculum

As a second-year Computer Science (IT) student, this roadmap is also designed to align perfectly with my university studies. The courses I undertake here will deepen my understanding of topics I am studying academically, helping me excel and achieve the top rank in my class. These topics include:
* C# and OOP
* Databases
* Windows Forms
* Web Fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Additionally, I will be studying **Java** through Eng. Adel Nassim's excellent course on YouTube.
